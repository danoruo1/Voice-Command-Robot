# Voice-Command-Robot
Robot that moves on voice command
Utilizing The Mbot Robot and the CyberPi Package, I created code that allows the robot to move on voice command. Saying "red" stops the robot completely, saying "yellow" will allow the robot to move at a slow speed, and saying "green" will allow the robot to move at a faster speed.
The Robot must be connected to wifi to work, so it can communicate with the CyberPi Cloud.
